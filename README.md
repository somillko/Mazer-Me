# Mazer-Me
Maze solving Algorithm in C. Uses graph data structures for creating the maze in form of nodes and edges. Then utilizes BFS and backtracking to solve the maze.

# The Code
the code is complete in itself and you need to just run it. When run the first thing the code asks for is the maze size which must be greater than 2 , in order to generate the maze. Then it gives up four options-

* Print Maze.
* Print the solved Maze.
* Solve the Maze yourself.
* Exit and start a new game.

Do accordingly and see the beauty.
